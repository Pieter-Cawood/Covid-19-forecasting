# Covid-19-forecasting
Deep MLP Meta-regression forecasting model, which utilises meta-features to improve the ensemble's forecasting accuracy. 
With this implementation we show that the inclusion of meta-features generally improves the ensembleâ€™s forecast accuracy across two forecast horizons of 7 and 14 days.
